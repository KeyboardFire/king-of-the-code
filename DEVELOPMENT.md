# Development of KingOfTheCode

## Programmers

Currently, I (KeyboardFire, [Doorknob on Stack Exchange](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/3808/doorknob)) am the only contributer to the code. However, if you'd like to suggest improvements and collaborate on development with me, you're more than welcome to!

## Tools

I used the following tools to create this framework:

- First and foremost, the OS, obviously. All development was done on Ubuntu, so nothing has been tested on any other OS. Please notify me if something borks on a different OS and I'll try to fix it right away.
- All of the work was done in zsh. Never once did I leave my z-shell console. (This isn't really necessary to say, per se, but I just thought I'd mention it because zsh is awesome ;) )
- Vim was the IDE / text editor used to write the actual code. This is why the (tiny) .gitignore looks like what it does.
- Oh yeah, and this entire project is stored in a git repository. (Which is probably obvious, since I'm guessing you're reading this because you found it via Github.)
